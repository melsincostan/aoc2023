Code and notes about trying to learn rust using AoC 2023 puzzles

## Thoughts
### Day 1

- Part 1 seems like it is decent enough, it looks somewhat like rust code probably?
- Part 2 is bad, that if / else is way too long, i should find something better
- Using tests seems like a good habit to have?
