Code and notes about trying to learn rust using AoC 2023 puzzles // started late on 10.12.2023

## Thoughts
### Day 1

- Part 1 seems like it is decent enough, it looks somewhat like rust code probably?
- Part 2 is bad, that if / else is way too long, i should find something better
- Using tests seems like a good habit to have?

### Day 2

- Part 1: maybe that's a bit too many functions? Solve works with chained `map()` calls which is cool
- Part 2: can't have multiple `map()` calls after one another for some reason? That can't be good
